  summary: Simplify your setup.py
  description: |
    Writing a setup.py typically involves lots of boilerplate and copy-pasting from project to project.
    This package aims to simplify that and bring some DRY principle to python packaging. For more
    information and examples, please refer to: https://github.com/zsimic/setupmeta.
    This package is only required to enable the building of Conda Python packages that
    make use of setupmeta (which is otherwise ordinarily installed dynamically
    as part of the setup.py workflows).
